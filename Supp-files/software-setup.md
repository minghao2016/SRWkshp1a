Please note that code was devloped/tested on Windows/Mac/Linux in a custom conda environment with the libraries (see next cell for information):

* Windows: Running windows-10 (64-bit OS ): Intel core i7-4600M; CPU: 2.9G0Hz
* Mac: Macbook Pro
* Linux: NIH Biowulf HPC cluster 

### **Packages and Libraries used in this workshop**

### Getting ready with rdkit/mordred/Other-libraries using Anaconda

Based on our experience, on a high-speed internet connection, the setting up of environment with the above mentioned libraries will take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes.

Please note the attendees will work on a cloud instance for this workshop and wont be needing any local python/library installations. If the workshop attendees want to use the local software (anaconda/Jupyter/other python libraries mentioned above), then we recommend the attendees to complete/test the software/library installations ahead of time.
